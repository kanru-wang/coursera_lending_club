## Machine Learning Assignment: Predicting Lending Club's loan defaults

1) Built a decision tree in Python without using Machine Learning libraries.
The process of building decision tree follows three early stopping conditions: 
    1. when maximum depth limit is reached
    2. when minimum node size is reached
    3. when minimum error reduction is reached

2) Implemented AdaBoost on decision stumps in Python. Machine Learning libraries are not used.
